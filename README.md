# desirely

## What does desirely mean?

It is a made up word, and its intended meaning is *with desire*.

The reason for naming a habit tracking app *desirely* is the belief that the habits we are pursuing ought to align with the *big desires we have for our lives*. This might sound obvious, but it is tremendously easy to pursue habits for the sake of outward appearance, or to keep up with our friends, or because the productivity zeitgeist tells us to.

## What does desirely do?

It is a (WIP) habit tracking application, created primarily as an exuse to play around with fun new web tech. It was built with TypeScript, Remix, Prisma, and Supabase.

## Development

*TODO*: instructions for setting up Supabase

To run desirely locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:
```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
