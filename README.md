# desirely

## What does desirely mean?

It is a made up word, and its intended meaning is *with desire*.

The habits we are pursuing ought to align with the *big desires we have for our lives*. This might sound obvious, but it is easy to instead pursue habits for the sake of outward appearance, or to keep up with our friends, or because of what the productivity zeitgeist tells us.

## What does desirely do?

It is a (WIP) habit tracking application, created primarily as an exuse to play around with fun new web tech. It was built with TypeScript, Remix, Prisma, and Supabase.

## Development

*TODO*: instructions for setting up Supabase

To run desirely locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:
```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
